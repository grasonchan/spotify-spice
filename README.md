# Spotify Spice

[Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) theme, to change Spotify client UI.

Based on Spotify original theme.

**Note:** Require Spicetify **v2.2.0** or higher! Otherwise, performance problems will happen when the turntable rotate!

Develop and test on macOS. If there's any problem, please open issue or PR.

## About Turntable

Use CSS to achieve, not picture. This means it can be scaled to any size, but make sure the album cover is not blurry.

Actually, the rotation of the turntable was created at spicetify v1, but in some cases, animation is affected by other factors. I think "fullAppDisplay.js high GPU usage" is the reason. Fortunately, it's normal now!

The turntable inspired by [Netease Music](https://music.163.com) and [Smartisan OS build-in Music Player](https://www.smartisan.com/os/#/beauty) (not include code).
